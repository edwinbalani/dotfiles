This directory contains vendored copies of installers that you are encourage to
run with 'curl | sh'.  To avoid building that pattern into these dotfiles'
installer, a static copy of each install script is kept here.

These install scripts invariably download content from the internet, but here
they can be vetted by interested parties before running ~/dotfiles/install.sh.
Assuming the integrity of this git repo, there remains less opportunity for the
install scripts themselves to be tampered with, even if/when the webserver
you're encourage to curl it from is compromised.
